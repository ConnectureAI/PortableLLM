## Dental Practice Workflows

### 1. Patient Communication Analysis

**Use Case**: Analyze patient feedback, reviews, and communications to improve service quality.

**Example Input**:
```
Patient Email: "I'm concerned about the treatment plan you discussed. 
The cost seems high and I'm not sure I understand all the procedures. 
Could you explain this in simpler terms?"
```

**PortableLLM Prompt Template**:
```
Analyze the following patient communication for:
1. Emotional sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
2. Specific concerns raised
3. Recommended response approach
4. Priority level for follow-up

Patient Communication: {input}

Please provide a professional analysis suitable for dental practice management.
```

**Example Output**:
```
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
- Overall Sentiment: Concerned but cooperative
- Emotional Indicators: Anxiety about cost, confusion about procedures
- Tone: Respectful and seeking clarification

CONCERNS IDENTIFIED:
1. Financial concern about treatment cost
2. Lack of understanding of procedures
3. Need for clearer explanation

RECOMMENDED RESPONSE APPROACH:
1. Acknowledge concerns empathetically
2. Provide simplified explanation with visual aids
3. Discuss payment options and insurance coverage
4. Schedule follow-up consultation for detailed discussion

PRIORITY LEVEL: High - Patient shows engagement but needs reassurance
```

### 2. Treatment Plan Explanations

**Use Case**: Generate patient-friendly explanations of complex dental procedures.

**Example Input**:
```
Patient needs: Root canal therapy on tooth #19, followed by crown placement.
Medical history: Diabetes, mild heart condition.
Insurance: Covers 80% major procedures.
```

**PortableLLM Prompt Template**:
```
Create a patient-friendly explanation for the following dental treatment:

Treatment: {treatment_details}
Patient Considerations: {medical_history}
Insurance Coverage: {insurance_info}

Please provide:
1. Simple explanation of the procedure
2. Benefits and necessity
3. Timeline and steps
4. Cost breakdown
5. Post-treatment care instructions

Use language appropriate for patients without medical background.
```

**Example Output**:
```
TREATMENT EXPLANATION FOR TOOTH #19

What You Need:
Your tooth has an infection in the nerve that requires a root canal treatment, 
followed by a protective crown.

Why This Treatment Is Important:
- Saves your natural tooth
- Eliminates pain and infection
- Prevents spread of infection to other teeth
- Maintains your ability to chew properly

Treatment Steps:
1. Root Canal (Visit 1, 90 minutes)
   - Remove infected tissue
   - Clean and seal the tooth
   - Place temporary filling
   
2. Crown Placement (Visit 2, 60 minutes, 2 weeks later)
   - Remove temporary filling
   - Place permanent crown
   - Final adjustments

Cost Breakdown:
- Root Canal: $1,200 (Your cost: $240 after insurance)
- Crown: $1,000 (Your cost: $200 after insurance)
- Total out-of-pocket: $440

Special Considerations:
Given your diabetes, we'll monitor healing closely and may prescribe 
antibiotics. Please maintain normal blood sugar levels before treatment.

After-Care:
- Avoid chewing on treated tooth for 24 hours
- Take prescribed medications as directed
- Call immediately if you experience severe pain or swelling
```

### 3. Insurance Documentation

**Use Case**: Generate pre-authorization and claim documentation.

**PortableLLM Prompt Template**:
```
Generate insurance documentation for:

Patient: {patient_info}
Procedure: {procedure_codes}
Medical Necessity: {clinical_findings}
Insurance: {insurance_details}

Provide:
1. Pre-authorization letter
2. Medical necessity justification
3. Supporting documentation summary
```

cold intolerance. FH: thyroid disease. PE: bradycardia, 
dry skin, delayed reflexes. Labs pending.
```

**PortableLLM Prompt Template**:
```
Enhance the following clinical note for completeness and clarity:

Clinical Note: {raw_note}

Please provide:
1. Structured SOAP note format
2. Complete symptom documentation
3. Differential diagnosis considerations
4. Recommended follow-up actions
5. ICD-10 coding suggestions

Maintain medical accuracy and professional standards.
```

**Example Output**:
```
ENHANCED CLINICAL NOTE

PATIENT: 45-year-old female

SUBJECTIVE:
Chief Complaint: Fatigue and weight gain over 6 months
History of Present Illness:
- Fatigue: Progressive over 6 months, affecting daily activities
- Weight gain: 15 pounds over 6 months without dietary changes
- Cold intolerance: New symptom, patient reports feeling cold in normal temperatures
Family History: Thyroid disease (specify relationship and type if known)

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs: Bradycardia noted (specify HR if available)
Physical Examination:
- Skin: Dry, consistent with hypothyroid state
- Neurological: Delayed deep tendon reflexes
- General: (Add weight, BP, temperature if available)

ASSESSMENT:
Primary Consideration: Hypothyroidism
- Clinical presentation consistent with thyroid hormone deficiency
- Family history supports genetic predisposition
- Physical findings support diagnosis

Differential Diagnoses to Consider:
1. Primary hypothyroidism (most likely)
2. Secondary hypothyroidism
3. Depression with somatic symptoms
4. Metabolic syndrome

PLAN:
Laboratory Studies:
- TSH, Free T4 (pending - follow up when available)
- Consider TPO antibodies if primary hypothyroidism confirmed
- Basic metabolic panel
- Lipid panel

Follow-up:
- Return visit in 1-2 weeks to review lab results
- Patient education on hypothyroidism provided
- Advised to monitor symptoms and report worsening

ICD-10 Coding Suggestions:
- E03.9 Hypothyroidism, unspecified (pending lab confirmation)
- R53.83 Other fatigue
- R63.5 Abnormal weight gain

Clinical Decision Support:
Consider starting levothyroxine therapy if TSH >10 mIU/L or if TSH 4.5-10 
with symptoms and positive antibodies.
```

### 2. Patient Education Materials

**Use Case**: Generate personalized health information and instructions.

**PortableLLM Prompt Template**:
```
Create patient education material for:

```

### 3. Quality Improvement Analysis

**Use Case**: Analyze patient outcomes and satisfaction data.

**Example Workflow**:
```
Upload anonymized patient satisfaction surveys and outcome data
→ PortableLLM analyzes trends and patterns
→ Generates recommendations for practice improvement
→ Creates action plans with measurable goals
```
